# node-cocoscii

This is a Node.js version of the [javascript (ES2015) version](https://github.com/mrspeaker/cocoscii) of [ASCIImage](http://asciimage.org/) by [Charles Parnot](http://twitter.com/cparnot). ASCIImage lets you create icons by defining some control points for drawing lines, paths, and circles. You can also style each shape individually.
